Data model consists of agencies and people.  Agencies can be organized in a tree like structure to better model their real live structure.  People can be assigned to any node in the tree.

The implementation uses the acts_as_tree plugin to manage the tree structure in a table called organization_nodes.  Agencies and People have a polymorphic has_one association to an organization node.  A simple module called Organizable sets up the associations and provides some delegation methods so that an agency can easily lookup its parent and children nodes.
